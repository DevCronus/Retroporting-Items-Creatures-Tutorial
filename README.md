# Retroporting-Items-Creatures-Tutorial
This is a tutorial on how to retroport items &amp; creatures to World of Warcraft version 3.3.5

# Disclamer These tools I am going to link are free tools and in no means my own.
Most of the tools I use: 
M2I Blender Addon: https://bitbucket.org/suncurio/blender-m2i-scripts/src/master/
Blender 2.79: https://download.blender.org/release/Blender2.79/

Thank you to everyone who developed these tools they help a lot with retroporting items
